							<h1 class="major">The Psychology of the Penalty Shootout</h1>
							<span class="image left"><img src="images/penalty.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Everything I'm going to discuss here is based on actual academic studies, most of which are by a Professor called Geir Jordet, a sports psychologist from Norway. He and his team have analyzed literally every single penalty shootout in the World Cup, Euros, and Champions League from 1976 to today.</p>
							<p>You might think science says all teams are pretty much equal, but actually, England might be uniquely shit at penalties.</p>
							<p>England have played in 8 penalty shootouts at the Euros and World Cup, winning.. 2.</p>	
							<p>English players, more than others, turn their gaze away from the goalkeeper and also respond quicker to the referee's whistle, which we know is bad news.</p>
							<p>Analysis from all the penalty shootouts for every country between 1976 and 2006 shows that, even for players who didn't participate in previous shootouts, they are more likely to miss if their team previously lost. And conversely, they are more likely to score if their team previously won. This is after controlling for player skill, so it's not just down to coming up against better teams. There is some element of choking.</p>
							<blockquote>"Of course, you can't help but think about Southgate, Batty, Pearce, Beckham, and Waddle, and all those penalty nightmare misses of old. It lurks in your mind somewhere, adding more pressure and a little bit of fear".</blockquote>
							<p>- Ashley Cole on the penalty shootout at the 2006 World Cup.</p>
							<p>So basically, if you're gonna play for England, one thing you can do is try not to learn anything about England's penalty shootout history. It's for the best.</p>
